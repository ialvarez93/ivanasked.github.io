Hello there!
############

Thanks for stopping by. I'm Ivan Alvarez and this site is about what I do over time. 

Who am I anyways?
******************

That's a very philosophical question. I'm a software developer from (and currently at) Venezuela. I really like learning new technologies, languages (Japanese I'm coming for you!) and many other things, so this blog is an outlet for that. Also, I'm available for hire, `let me know <ivalvarez22@gmail.com>`_  if you are interested in working together. 

What's with the name?
*********************

Explaining a joke it's pretty boring, but now that you asked, the name of the blog is Ivan Over Time, since the purpose is to self-document the learning process for reviewing, sharing and iterating. If you make that a function it would be something like (Ivan / Time), but between you and me, that actually describes the learning process and not the blog itself and since I don't want to be `mean <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_of_a_function>`_  I think the remainder represents the blog better, in other words (or should I said, symbols?) the `modulo operator <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation#In_programming_languages>`_  but it's hard to say that name out loud.

Where?
******

This blog is hosted in `Github Pages <https://github.com/ivanovertime/ivanovertime.github.io/>`_ feel free to check it out and tell how to make it better! 

When?
*****

Well, it took me about a week. Mostly because I couldn't decide the theme, so I went with the MVP and we'll see how it goes. It's all part of learning.   

Why?
*****

Well, long story short, when I read `Learn in public <https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/>`_ by Shawn Wang, it made sense. Also, Ultra learning was instrumental and aspirational, but a bit far away for me. The techniques are very useful, but the mindset is what made this blog posible. The world is full talented people!    

How?
*****

Well, this blog is built with `Nikola <http://getnikola.com/>`_ with the `Hack theme <https://themes.getnikola.com/v8/hack/>`_ slightly tweaked. 

I'll do a guide on making one in the near future, in the mean time check `this guide <https://jiaweizhuang.github.io/blog/nikola-guide/>`_  for more info, it helped me a lot.
