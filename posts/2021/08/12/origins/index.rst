Why a blog?
###########

Well, as the saying goes, “the shoemaker's son always goes barefoot”. `Learning in public <https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/>`_ It's not only much more effective and efficient, but with the added benefit of accountability and the possibility of contributing to a community `it's a healthy choice <https://hackernoon.com/the-importance-of-developer-communities-adv3u0u>`_. But you need a platform for that and since I really want to be focused, SNS are out of the map (between you and me, dev.to gives me FOMO every 5 minutes, makes me really anxious, or both!) So I had to borrow and use the tools to make my humble space in this little corner over here.  

What are the requirements? 
***************************

After I got my HDD killed by a blackout (and probably old age if I'm being honest), I got an even older HDD as a replacement, and I've been doing some tutorials, so here (hopefully) I'll be putting side projects of data science/engineering and my thoughts and tips, especially for my fellows devs in Venezuela. So I choose you Nikola!


Why Nikola?

1. I think that I might *get* the code base, and by that I mean:

   * Mostly very well documented. OK, no, It's really well documented.
   * It's written in python, so I don't have to venture too far from my learning range.

2. It has an active and good community, which I would like to be a part of, eventually. 

   * Every page can be downloaded if you click the pretty button that says `Source <http://ivanovertime.github.io/posts/origins/index.rst>`_ 
   * That's a ready-made cheat sheet for you! Wonderful!  
 
3. Supports every format I would want to use as an input, even some that I might find questionable like .doc. 

   * But the really fun part is the support for Jupyter Notebooks.


I still need to fix the mobile version, but I'm starting anyway (Sorry about the navbar). So, well with this out of the way. The blog it's officially open! Mandatory Hello world code:
